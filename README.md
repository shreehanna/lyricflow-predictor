# ðŸŽ¤ LyricFlow Predictor

A next-word prediction bot trained on the iconic *Good Luck, Babe!* lyrics by Chappell Roan. You type 2 words from the song, it predicts what comes next â€” like autocomplete, but make it âœ¨queer pop geniusâœ¨.

## ðŸ’¡ What It Does

- Takes **2 words** from the lyrics as input
- Uses a **3-word N-gram model** to guess the next word
- Returns up to **3 top predictions**
- Built in Python, powered by `collections.defaultdict` & `random`

## ðŸ›  How to Run

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/shreehanna/lyricflow-predictor.git
cd lyricflow-predictor
